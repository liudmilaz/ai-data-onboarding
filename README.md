> **Core Principle:** Human data specialists lead the analysis, critical thinking, and architectural decisions, while AI serves as a high-velocity accelerator and Socratic coach.  
> **Original Stack:** PostgreSQL + dbt Core + Docker Compose + Metabase  
> **Google Cloud Stack:** BigQuery + Dataform + Cloud Run + Looker Studio + Gemini AI + Antigravity

## 1. Executive Summary

**LINIA** is an interactive, human-led and AI-powered onboarding and upskilling platform for data specialists. It is built around a modern principle: human specialists lead the exploratory analysis, critical thinking, and architectural decisions, while AI acts as a high-velocity accelerator and Socratic coach.

The learner begins with six raw CSV files and a business specification for **Invented Software Inc.** (a fast-growing B2B SaaS company selling recurring-fee business software to small merchants across 8 international markets). The data specialist builds a complete analytics platform end-to-end on Google Cloud:

$$\text{Raw CSVs} \longrightarrow \text{BigQuery Lakehouse} \longrightarrow \text{Dataform Transformations (in Antigravity)} \longrightarrow \text{Looker Studio Dashboard}$$

Throughout the journey, an embedded **AI Mentor** powered by **Google Gemini** provides Socratic, spoiler-controlled guidance, challenging the specialist to test hypotheses and defend conclusions rather than simply copying code.

## 2. Technical Stack Translation

| Original Architecture | Google Cloud / AI Studio Stack | Rationale & Enterprise Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PostgreSQL (Local / Docker)** | **Google BigQuery** (`invented_software_*`) | Petabyte-scale serverless lakehouse; zero index tuning; native column-level security. |
| **dbt Core (Docker Container)** | **Google Cloud Dataform** (SQLX) | BigQuery-native, serverless SQL compilation with built-in lineage and automated assertions. |
| **Docker Compose** | **Google Cloud Run** | Zero-infra serverless container hosting with auto-scaling to zero and HTTPS endpoints. |
| **Metabase** | **Looker Studio** | Native BigQuery connector; interactive executive BI scorecards and real-time refreshes. |
| **Claude Code / AGENTS.md** | **Gemini 1.5 / 2.0 & Antigravity** | Embedded Socratic AI mentor with strict spoiler-control guidelines and agentic pair programming. |
| **Manual Scripts** | **Google Cloud Build CI/CD** | Automated image builds, Dataform compilation checks, and continuous deployment. |

## 3. Dedicated Trainee Materials vs. Production Solutions

To support effective hands-on learning, this repository cleanly separates **starter training materials** from **completed reference solutions**:

1. **Training Materials (`training_materials/`)**:
   - `training_materials/dataform_starter/`: Clean Dataform configuration with raw BigQuery declarations and empty model templates (`.sqlx.starter`) with TODO guidance.
   - `training_materials/sql_exercises/`: Investigation queries and Socratic prompts for each curriculum phase.
   - `training_materials/looker_studio/`: Guide to building executive scorecards and cohort retention charts from scratch.
2. **Ready Results & Solutions (`solutions/`)**:
   - `solutions/dataform_completed/`: Complete, production-grade Dataform pipeline (16 models, marts, and data quality assertions).
   - `solutions/sql_reference/`: Verified SQL queries avoiding the 3 deliberate traps.
   - `solutions/looker_studio/`: Dashboard specifications and formula definitions.
   - `solutions/executive_metrics.json`: Verified ground-truth KPIs (€18,117 Exit ARR, 9.47% churn).

## 4. The 3 Deliberate Data Traps & Verified Truth

The core philosophy of this curriculum is that **the pipeline is the means, not the goal**. Real data specialists must catch subtle data discrepancies that silent tools miss:

### Trap 1: Minor Units (Cents)
- **The Issue**: All monetary amounts in raw CSVs (`mrr_local`, `amount_eur`, `price_eur`, `cogs_eur`, `spend_amount`) are stored in minor units (cents).
- **Impact**: Omitting `/ 100` causes a **100× error** (€113,785 instead of €1,137.85).
- **Resolution**: Staged views explicitly divide by 100.0 into float/numeric fields.

### Trap 2: Currency Join Fan-Out
- **The Issue**: Joining `raw_subscriptions` directly to `raw_markets` on `currency` fans out rows from 117 to **300**, because 4 European markets (DE, FR, IT, ES) share the EUR currency.
- **Impact**: Inflates total revenue by **2.61×** (€4,433.36 vs. €1,697.75).
- **Resolution**: Foreign key must route through the merchant: `raw_subscriptions.merchant_id → raw_merchants.country_code → raw_markets.country_code`.

### Trap 3: Stock Among Flows (The 16× Trap)
- **The Issue**: `raw_operating_costs` contains a line item with `cost_category = 'cash_balance_eom'`. This is a point-in-time balance sheet **stock**, not an operating cost **flow**! It comprises 93.8% of the column sum.
- **Impact**: An unfiltered sum shows **€54,814/month** in operating expenses. A company with ~€1.5k/month in revenue appears to have a 1-month runway.
- **Resolution**: `stg_operating_costs` classifies `is_cost_flow = (cost_category != 'cash_balance_eom')`. Real operating costs are **€3,419/month**, revealing an implied cash runway of **~17.6 months** (€57,235 balance ÷ €3,253 net burn).

## 5. Verified Ground Truth Metrics

| Metric | Verified Value | Notes / Denominator Defense |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Jan 2024 MRR** | **€1,137.85** | Inclusive end-date, no proration. |
| **Dec 2024 MRR** | **€1,640.77** | Peak 2024 MRR. |
| **Dec 2025 MRR** | **€1,509.78** | Exit month MRR. |
| **Exit ARR** | **€18,117.34** | Dec 2025 MRR × 12. |
| **Logo Churn Rate** | **9.5%** | 9 churned ÷ **95 paying merchants** (65 non-paying signups excluded). |
| **Clean Monthly Opex** | **€3,419 / mo** | Cost flows only (excluding `cash_balance_eom`). |
| **Monthly CAC Spend** | **€1,352 / mo** | €32,439 across 24 months. |
| **Monthly Net Burn** | **€3,253 / mo** | Clean Opex (€3,419) + CAC (€1,352) − Revenue (€1,517). |
| **Latest Cash Balance** | **€57,235** | Dec 31, 2025 point-in-time cash balance. |
| **Implied Runway** | **~17.6 Months** | €57,235 ÷ €3,253. |

## 7. Quick Start & Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Initialize GCP Environment
```bash
cd gcp
chmod +x *.sh
./setup_environment.sh
```
*This enables BigQuery, Dataform, Cloud Run, Artifact Registry, and AI Platform APIs, and initializes the BigQuery datasets in `aiwomen26ham-4452`.*

### Step 2: Ingest the Raw Data into BigQuery
```bash
./load_bigquery_tables.sh
```
*Loads all 6 CSV files into `aiwomen26ham-4452.invented_software_raw`.*

### Step 3: Deploy the Training Portal to Cloud Run
```bash
./deploy_cloud_run.sh
```
*Builds the container via Cloud Build and deploys to Cloud Run with public HTTPS access.*

## 8. Development & Local Run

To run the Next.js training portal locally:
```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the onboarding portal, interact with the AI mentor, explore the side-by-side model comparator, and inspect the Executive BI Dashboard.
